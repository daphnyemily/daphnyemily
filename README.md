### Hi there ✨✨ I am Daphny Emily ✨✨

![Full Stack Developer](https://github.com/daphnyemily/daphnyemily/blob/main/DaphnyEmily.png)

I am a Software Engineer from Boston, MA looking to network within the tech community and beyond. Currently expanding my portfolio and looking to join a dynamic team.

As a very proud Kriola 🇨🇻 (Cape Verdean woman) born and raised in Brockton, MA, I am so proud to come from a city with a large diverse population of people from around the globe. Being surrounded by so many immigrants I have grown to see the struggle my parents and many parents have made to give children like me a better future. This is why I strived to become a Software Engineer.

With being grounded in my identity, I seek to empower women, especially women of color, in a world that so often chooses to silence them.



## Skills: NODE JS / REACT / JS / HTML / CSS

▪️I’m currently building my portfolio
