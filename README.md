## Hi there ✨ I am Daphny Emily ✨
### Full Stack Developer
![Full Stack Developer](https://github.com/daphnyemily/daphnyemily/blob/main/DaphnyEmily.png)

I am a Software Engineer from Boston, MA looking to network within the tech community and beyond. Currently expanding my portfolio and looking to join a dynamic team.

As a Cape Verdean woman, I am proud to come from a place with a large diverse population of people. Being surrounded by so many immigrants I have grown to see the struggle my parents and many parents have made to give children like me a better future. This is why I strived to become a Software Engineer. 

Being the firstborn in the US, I was the translator and the technician. My love for tech started when I set up our first computer. I still remember the excitement of hearing the AOL Dial-Up sound. For me, I thought it was too late to become an engineer, but here I am; driven, determined, and a Full Stack Developer.

With being grounded in my identity, I seek to empower women, especially women of color, in a world that so often chooses to silence them. Very proud kriola 🇨🇻.
